# Further Development

Although this app has working functionality there are many ways that it could be developed further in the future.


### Backend weather API call

The current version calls the weather API in the front end. This is not good practice and in the future I would remove this and create a backend service to call this API via proxy instead. This allows the API key to be in the backend and is much more secure.

### Map of selected location

To add to the current functionality I would use a map API to show the user a map of the selected location with further information about the area. This would be a good addition to the current weather display page adding more useful information for the user.

### Hotels in the area

Adding onto the map API I would similarly use an API to display a carousel of local hotels in the area of the selected location. This would allow the user to potentially see somewhere they would want to stay when looking up information about the area.
